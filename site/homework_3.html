    <h2><a name="section1">Abstract</a></h2>
    During nervous system development, neuronal axons are guided to their targets via extracellular guidance
    molecule-responsive reorganisation of the growth cone cytoskeleton. Netrin is a critical axon guidance molecule
    during neuronal development. Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC), UNC5C, and Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM)
    are important netrin receptors, which will bind with netrin and regulate the cytoskeleton dynamics within
    the neuronal growth cone. These receptors have been found associating with the attraction and repulsion of the axon
    growth cone towards the netrin chemical signal and would interact with microtubules directly. Fascin involves in the
    formation of neuronal growth cone filopodia formation by bundling actin filaments (F-actin). The structural determination
    of netrin receptors interaction with microtubule, and fascin bundling F- actin is critical for understanding the molecular
    mechanisms underlying axon guidance and the growth cone dynamics. This knowledge is significant for understanding neuronal
    developmental disorders and synaptic connections in adults. Interestingly, these mechanisms are also identified in
    tumorigenesis and metastasis. In this project, we aim to structurally determine how netrin receptors bind and
    regulate microtubules, and fascin bundles F-actin. We will purify and characterise the proteins, optimize sample
    preparation, and use cryo-electron microscopy techniques to obtain high-resolution structures.
    Currently, we have successfully purified recombinant DCC and UNC5C, identified the binding between DCC and microtubules,
    and reconstructed tomograms of fascin bundling F-actin in vitro. Sample preparation and cryo-EM sample preparation for
    DCC microtubule complexes are underway.
    <h2><a name="section2">Introduction</a></h2>
        <h3><a name="section3">Axon Guidance</a></h3>
            <p>Axon guidance is a critical fundamental process in the development of nervous systems, essential for forming functional neuronal circuits. The growing axon will be guided by molecular guidance cues to navigate through a complex environment, travel a long distance to reach the target location, and then forms synaptic connections. The guidance molecules have been found binding to different transmembrane receptors which are expressed on the growth cone – the apex of an extending axon. These guidance molecules can draw either attraction or repulsion effects to the growth cone, which induce neuronal growth towards or avoid the specific location. Currently, a large number of guidance molecules and receptors have been identified participating in axon guidance in several areas of the nervous system and during different developmental stages. In this project, we are particularly interested in the guidance molecule netrin, and its receptors deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), UNC5C, and Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM).
                The midline crossing of the commissural neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) is a representative example of this intricate system and shows the significance of axon guidance in neuronal development. Such axon projections are required for the bilaterally symmetric animals to connect both sides of the CNS, to process and coordinate sensory modalities, motor responses, and cognitive functions (Vulliemoz, 2005). The commissural neurons in the spinal cord have been studied extensively, especially the dorsal interneuron 1 (dI-1) population. DI-1 neurons are able to project in a circumferential path from the dorsal roof plate towards the ventral midline at the floor plate (Alvarez et a., 2021) (Figure. 1). Netrin draws the attraction effect to the growing neurons via binding with DCC, induces axon extension towards the ventral direction (Kennedy et al., 1994; Keino-Masu et al., 1996). However, the gradient of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) family and draxin induce the repellent effect, making the axons avoid the roof plate area (Butler and Dodd, 2003; Islam et al., 2009). Moreover, evidence has shown BMPs could continuously affect the growth rate of the commissural neurons at their cell bodies, suggesting BMPs also have temporal regulatory effects to ensure the axons receive the subsequent guidance signals at particular timing (Phan et a., 2010). Axons then enter the floor plate and cross the midline through fine-tuned regulations of the receptor expression. Roundabout (Robo) family – receptors of repellent cue slits are upregulated to reduce the axon sensitivity of netrin. The netrin-induced attraction is also silenced via Robo interacting with DCC (Stein and Tessier-Lavigne, 2001). The mechanism of switching dominant guidance receptors not only ensures the axons in the floor plate finish the crossing, but also prevents the axons from re-entering the floor plate (de Ramon Francàs, 2017; Stoeckli, 2018).</p>
            <p>Faulty connections or disintegration of the neuronal wiring leads to a great number of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Mutations on the genes which encode the guidance cue molecules have been found in patients with genetic disorders such as congenital mirror movements and horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (Srour et al., 2010) (Chan et al., 2006). Preliminary data suggest the involvement of axon guidance signalling in neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s Disease, and Alzheimer's disease (Gilman et al., 2012; Antonell et al., 2013; Bossers et al., 2009).

        <h3><a name="section4">Growth Cone and Netrin Receptors</a></h3>
            <p>Growth cone is a dynamic structure at the distal tip of an axon, which conducts the axonal outgrowth and turns towards specific locations. The transient shape changing of the growth cone is achieved by highly dynamic actin filaments (F-actin) and microtubules (MT). Based on the shape and cytoskeleton distribution, a growth cone can be divided into central domain (C-domain), transition zone (T-zone), and peripheral region (P-region) (Figure 2). The C-domain connects axon and growth cone, with MT being the dominant cytoskeleton. Bundled MT from the axon shaft starts to de-fasciculate and extend individually towards the T-zone and P-region. The P-region contains finger shaped projections named filopodia and flat shaped protrusions named lamellipodia. F-actin bundles with hexagonal arrays forms in the filopodia, while the F-actins forms branched networks in the lamellipodia (Atherton et al., 2022).</p>
            <p>Several studies have shown that the netrin receptors would directly interact with the MT to regulate the axon outgrowth and turning based on the netrin signals. DCC is a transmembrane receptor widely expressed in the nervous system which mediates both growth cone attraction and repulsion (Boyer and Gupton, 2018). The extracellular part of the DCC contains four Ig-like domains and six fibronectin type-III (FN3) domains (Finci et al., 2014). Most structural studies were done on the extracellular domains which reveal the binding sites of the netrin, while the structural knowledge on the intracellular domain still lacks. The DCC cytoplasmic tail has three conserved motifs P1, P2, and P3, but it is not folded into a defined structure. According to immunoprecipitation study, the DCC P2 and P3 domain would directly interact with beta tubulin isoform 3 (TUBB3) on the MT and mediate the netrin induce axon outgrowth and turning (Qu et al., 2013).</p>
            <p>The UNC5 family is highly conserved, with three domains in the cytoplasmic region, namely ZU5, UPA, and death domain (DD). Similar to DCC, UNC5C would directly interact with TUBB3, while netrin would inhibit this interaction and induce axonal repulsion (Shao et al., 2017). Interestingly, binding between DCC P1 and UNC5 UPA domains was identified using yeast two-hybrid system and thus induces netrin mediated UNC5/DCC repulsion (Hong et al., 1999; Finci et al., 2014). DSCAM could respond to netrin signals either individually or coordinate with DCC or UNC5C (). Netrin also stimulates the direct binding of DSCAM to TUBB3, while DCC and DSCAM would coordinate with each other interdependently for the direct association with TUBB3 in netrin (Huang et al., 2015). The structure of DSCAM intracellular domain has not been solved and the molecular mechanism of DSCAM signalling has not been well understood.</p>
        <h3><a name="section5">Fascin Bundles Actin Filament</a></h3>
            <p>Fascin is a highly conserved protein which binds and bundles the F-actin. The structure of fascin has been heavily studied, high resolution structure of fascin indicates it has four β trefoil domains (Figure.3). However, the structure of fascin binds and crosslinks F-actin is still yet to be solved, and the F-actin binding site of fascin and fascin binding site of actin has not been confirmed. The first actin binding site was proposed between V33 and T47 in the β trefoil-1 domain, based on the binding site sequence similarity with other actin binding proteins (Ono et al., 1997). The second binding site is proposed to be located between β trefoil-2 and 3 domains. Mutation studies on phosphorylation sites (S39 and S274) in these areas alter the F-actin bundling in different cells, which support the hypotheses of the actin binding sites, and the involvement of fascin phosphorylation in fascin binding and crosslinking F-actin (Aratyn et al., 2007; Zanet et al., 2012).</p>
        <h3><a name="section6">Cryo-Electron Microscopy</a></h3>  
            <p>With the development of direct electron detector cameras, cryo-electron microscopy has become a desired method in structural biology. In this project, we planned to use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to study the structure of DCC, UNC5C, and DSCAM interacting with MT, and fascin bundling the F-actin. Both cryo-EM and cryo-ET utilise transmission electron microscopy to visualise the prepared samples. To protect the specimen from electron bombardment and the vacuum environment within the EM column, samples are prepared either by applying a coating of heavy metal salt (negative staining) or plunge freezing the sample into vitrified near-native environment (hence the name cryo-EM). The basic principle of structure determination using Cryo-EM is best explained by the projection-slice theorem (Equation 1), where F_2 and F_3are the 2- and 3- dimensional Fourier transform operators respectively, P_2 is the projection operator, S_2 is the slice operator. This equation states that the Fourier transform of 2D projection from a 3D volume is equal to the 2D slice through the origin in Fourier space of a 3D Fourier transform. </p>
            <p>The image produced by TEM is the 2D projection of the specimen. In cryo-EM, protein structures can be determined by reconstructing 2D projection images of the protein particles in different orientations into a 3D map (Figure.4). While in cryo-ET, micrographs of tilted specimen (tilt series) are reconstructed into 3D maps (tomograms) (Figure.4). Further processing and analysis such as sub-tomogram averaging, and structure segmentation could be applied to the tomograms.</p>

            <h3><a name="section8">Protein Expression</a></h3>
                <p>DNA sequences of human netrin receptor intracellular domains were synthesised in pET-30a (+) vectors (Bio Basic). All sequences contain an N terminal 6xHis tag with a thrombin cleavage site and an N terminal S-tag with an enterokinase cleavage site. Plasmids for human fascin-1 mutants were kindly provided by Prof. Maddy Parsons's lab. All plasmids were transformed into different strains of chemically competent E. coli cells by mixing 100ng of DNA with 100 µl thawed bacteria, following 45 seconds of heat shock.</p>
                <p>For recombinant protein expression, overnight culture of E. coli BL21 (DE3) was inoculated into autoclaved media in a 1:1000 ratio. For LB media, cultures were incubated at 37°C with 180 rpm shaking. 0.1 mM of Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to the culture when the OD600 reached 0.8. Induced cultures were further incubated overnight at 18°C. For ZYM-5052 autoinduction media, cells were incubated overnight at 18°C after inoculation.
                    E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 20 minutes. 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 10% v/v glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), pH 7.5) was used to resuspend 1 g of pellet. 1mg/ml of lysozyme and DNase I was added after resuspension and incubated on ice for 30 minutes to lyse the cells. To ensure proper cell lysis, the lysate was further sonicated for 10 mins on ice. The whole cell lysate was centrifuged at 48000g for 30 minutes to separate the inclusion body and the soluble fraction.

            <h3><a name="section9">Protein Purification</a></h3>
                <p>Protein purification was carried out using ӒKTA pure™ chromatography system (Cytiva). For Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), HisTrap HP 1 ml (Cytiva) was used to purify His-tagged recombinant protein. Columns were equilibrated with the IMAC wash buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.5). The soluble fractions separated as described previously were filtered with 0.2 µm pore size membrane before loading to the column. Sample loading was carried out at the flow rate of 0.2 ml/min to ensure proper binding of the His-tag to the column. After sample application, the column was washed with 30 ml of wash buffer with additional 50 mM of Imidazole to reduce the non-specific binding. Protein was eluted in a gradient from 10% to 100% IMAC elution buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.5).</p>
                <p>The procedures of ion exchange chromatography (IEX) were identical to IMAC apart from the elution buffer being used. HiTrap Q HP (Cytiva) and HiTrap SP HP (Cytiva) were used for anion and cation exchange respectively. Protein bound to the column was eluted in a gradient from 0% to 100% IEX elution buffer (20 mM HEPES, 1 M NaCl, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.5).
                    Size exclusion chromatography was used to separate proteins based on their molecular weights using columns packed in different pore size resin: Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (Cytiva), Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL (Cytiva), Superose™ 6 Increase 10/300 GL (Cytiva). Protein samples were concentrated to 200 µl before loading to the columns.
