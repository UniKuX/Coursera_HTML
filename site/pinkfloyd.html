    <h1>I confess I've never felt like a passenger.</h1>
    <h3>"Not the torturer will scare me, nor the body's final fall,
        nor the barrels of death's rifles, nor the shadows on the wall, 
        nor the night when to the ground the last dim star of pain, 
        is hurled but the blind indifference of a merciless,&nbsp;unfeeling&nbsp;world."
    </h3>
    <p>Roger Waters &copy;</p>
